Here I document how I went about gathering data from RMIS.  Mostly it is just
a record of the Queries used and where I put the resulting data files.

## Location data

I figured it would be feasible to just download the entire location data base.  The query that seemed
to make that possible produced this in the email from RMIS:
```
WHERE state IN ('AK','BC','CA','CO','FO','HS','ID','MI','MN','MT','ND','NE','OR','WA','WI','WY')
```
That's fine.  I did that query on November 4, 2014.  It is a csv file and I have placed it into:
`./data/locations.csv`
