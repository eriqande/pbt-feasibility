## Initial Maneuvers

Here we look at some properties to make sure that we got everything we wanted:
```{r}
# load it in
chin_rec <- readRDS("data/chinook_recoveries.rds")
dim(chin_rec)
```
This accords well with what the RMIS data base tells us when we query All Recoveries for 2002-2012 on chinook:
```
Your All Recoveries query retrieved too many rows (1452480)
```

Let's grab the catch-sample data too:
```{r}
catch_samp <- readRDS("data/catch_sample.rds")
```
